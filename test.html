                                the script on all her assumptions—a “smart, sophisticated, and
                                fun” (Oprah Daily) novel from the author of Eligible, Rodham, and
                                Prep. Sally Milz is a sketch writer for The Night Owls, a
                                late-night live comedy show that airs every Saturday. With a
                                couple of heartbreaks under her belt, she’s long abandoned the
                                search for love, settling instead for the occasional hook-up,
                                career success, and a close relationship with her stepfather to
                                round out a satisfying life. But when Sally’s friend and fellow
                                writer Danny Horst begins dating Annabel, a glamorous actress who
                                guest-hosted the show, he joins the not-so-exclusive group of
                                talented but average-looking and even dorky men at the show—and in
                                society at large—who’ve gotten romantically involved with
                                incredibly beautiful and accomplished women. Sally channels her
                                annoyance into a sketch called the Danny Horst Rule, poking fun at
                                this phenomenon while underscoring how unlikely it is that the
                                reverse would ever happen for a woman. Enter Noah Brewster, a pop
                                music sensation with a reputation for dating models, who signed on
                                as both host and musical guest for this week’s show. Dazzled by
                                his charms, Sally hits it off with Noah instantly, and as they
                                collaborate on one sketch after another, she begins to wonder if
                                there might actually be sparks flying. But this isn’t a romantic
                                comedy—it’s real life. And in real life, someone like him would
                                never date someone like her … right? With her keen observations
                                and trademark ability to bring complex women to life on the page,
                                Curtis Sittenfeld explores the neurosis-inducing and
                                heart-fluttering wonder of love, while slyly dissecting the social
                                rituals of romance and gender relations in the modern age.

                                            couple of heartbreaks under her belt, she’s long abandoned the
                                            search for love, settling instead for the occasional hook-up,

                                            round out a satisfying life. But when Sally’s friend and fellow

                                            guest-hosted the show, he joins the not-so-exclusive group of

                                            society at large—who’ve gotten romantically involved with
                                            incredibly beautiful and accomplished women. Sally channels her

                                            collaborate on one sketch after another, she begins to wonder if
                                            there might actually be sparks flying. But this isn’t a romantic
